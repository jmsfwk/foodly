  This is based on Nadiya Hussain's Chicken Shawarma. It makes enough of the spice mix for two meals.
  
  A good teaspoon of garlic purée is a good addition, mix it with the chicken and oil before adding the spice mix

  This recipe also works really well on a barbeque. After mixing the chicken and spices mix together cook over hot coals
  until the chicken is golden.
