## Ingredients

- 5ml Chinese rice wine
- 11g chicken stock mix
- 2 ciabattas
- 21g wholegrain mustard
- 250g chicken thigh, diced
- 50g soft cheese
- 5g chives
- 80g fine green beans
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion
- 1 apple
- 1tsp flour
- olive oil
- salt and pepper

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas 7  
Boil half a kettle  
Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat
2. Chop the **apple** into wedges and remove the core  
Peel and chop the **brown onion** into wedges
3. Add the **diced chicken thigh** to the dish with **1 tsp** flour and cook for 30 secs  
Crush the **garlic cloves** open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins
4. Add the **chopped apple** and **onion wedges** with the **crushed garlic** and give everything a good stir  
Add the **chicken stock mix** and 200ml **boiled water**
5. Add the **Chinese rice wine** and stir through with the **wholegrain mustard** and **soft cheese**  
Bring to the boil over a high heat, then put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 30-35 min or until the chicken is cooked through – this is your **Normandy chicken & apple casserole**
6. Once the casserole is almost done, trim the **green beans** and add to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of **olive oil** and a pinch of **salt** (use tin foil to avoid mess!)  
Add the **ciabattas** to the other side of the tray
Put the tray in the oven for 7-9 min or until the green beans are tender but retaining a bite and the ciabattas are warm and crusty  
To serve, chop the **chives** and sprinkle them all over the **Normandy chicken & apple casserole** then season with **pepper**  
Serve the **green beans** and **crusty ciabattas** to the side
