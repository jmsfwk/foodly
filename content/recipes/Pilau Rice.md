## Ingredients

- 225g basmati white rice
- 1 tbsp olive oil or butter
- 1/2 medium onion, diced
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 420ml chicken or vegetable stock, water, or a mix of water and stock

## Method

1. Rinse the **rice** in a sieve under water until the water is barley 
cloudy then set aside.
2. Melt the **butter** or **oil** in a medium saucepan and gently fry the
 **onion** until translucent and soft.
3. Add the drained **rice** to the pan and mix to cover with the oil.
Toast for a minute until the tips of the rice turn translucent.
4. Add the **stock** or water, and salt. Turn the heat to medium-high and
 bring to the boil.
5. As soon as it comes to the boil turn the heat to low and cover with a 
well fitting lid. Cook for 15 – 18 minutes **without lifting the lid**.
Check that the rice has absorbed all the liquid and is cooked, if not cook
for a couple more minutes adding a couple of tablespoons of water if needed.
6. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to sit, covered, for 5 – 10 minutes.
7. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.

Additions like mushrooms or garlic can easily be added when frying the onions
and spices like cloves or bay leaves can be added along with the water.
