This is based on [Nadiya Hussain's Chicken Shawarma][1]. It makes enough of the spice mix for two meals.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp cornflour
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- ½ tsp ground cloves
- 1 tbsp cayenne
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 750g boneless chicken thighs, halved

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180℃ / gas mark 4.
2. Mix together the dry ingredients, then put half aside for another day.
3. Add the oil and chicken to a large bowl and mix together. Then add the spice mix and stir to coat the chicken.
4. Layer the chicken in a loaf tin or any other baking dish and bake in the oven for 40 minutes.
5. When cooked remove from the oven and rest for 10 minutes.
6. Chop the chicken into slices.

A good teaspoon of garlic purée is a good addition, mix it with the chicken and oil before adding the spice mix

This recipe also works really well on a barbeque. After mixing the chicken and spices mix together cook over hot coals
until the chicken is golden.
