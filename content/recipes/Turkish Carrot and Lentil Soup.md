The bulghur and lentils add some body and protein to this smokey,
comforting soup. Add a cautious pinch or two of cayenne at the end; it 
can be potent stuff.

This recipe is from a [Riverford][1] soup bag.

## Ingredients

- 1 onion
- 2 red peppers
- 400g carrots
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp cumin
- 40g red lentils
- 20g bulghur wheat
- 20g flaked almonds
- 1 lemon
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- fresh mint

## Method

1. Peel and slice the **onion**. Deseed and slice the **peppers**.
Peel and roughly chop the **carrots**. Warm 2 tbsp of oil in a large 
saucepan and gently fry them together for 10 minutes, until starting 
to soften.
2. Meanwhile, peel and chop the **garlic**.
3. Add the **garlic**, **bay**, **cumin**, **lentils** and **bulghur**
to the pan and cook for a futher 2 minutes before adding 800ml of water.
Bring to a simmer and season with salt and pepper. Cook gently for 25 minutes,
until everything is cooked and softened.
4. While the soup cooks, lightly toast the **almonds** in a dry frying pan
over a medium heat, until golden.
5. When ready, remove the **bay leaf** and blend until completely smooth.
Thin with a little more water is it seems thick. Taste and tweak the
seasoning with salt, pepper, a squeeze or 2 of **lemon** and a cautious
pinch of **cayenne**, to your liking.
6. Serve and garnish with the toasted **almonds** and some freshly chopped
**mint** leaves.
