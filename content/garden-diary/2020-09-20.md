Yesterday I bought some reduced strawberry plants, two Sweetheart and two
[Cambridge Favourite][Cambridge Favourite]. I thought the pots they were in
were a little small, so I've repotted them. Hopefully they will survive over 
winter.

I brought home some ceramic pots from Mam's the other day and today I got around
to cleaning (most of) them.

I've planted two pots of flowers for over winter. They are [Cyclamen][Cyclamen]
(I think they are *Cyclamen purpurascens* but the packaging didn't specify the variety)
and Tulips.
