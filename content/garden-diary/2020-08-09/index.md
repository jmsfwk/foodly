I planted out 5 pea plants today (*Hurst Green Shaft*). The two closest to the house
are bigger and have better root systems. They should grow to about 70cm, so I'll need
to new, taller stakes. They should be ready to harvest in about 10 weeks (mid October).

The beans I planted out last week (*Sonesta*) have lost all their leaves but are growing
a new set well, interestingly they have a different texture. I think that the original,
large leaves were damaged by the wind.

I harvested my first courgette today! It was a good size, but the wider end was a little
wooley. We added it to the Summery Sausage & Pea One-Pot recipe from Gousto.
