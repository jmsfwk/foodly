I thought the pots they were in were a little small, so I&amp;rsquo;ve repotted them. Hopefully they will survive over winter.
I brought home some ceramic pots from Mam&amp;rsquo;s the other day and today I got around to cleaning (most of) them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve planted two pots of flowers for over winter. They are Cyclamen (I think they are Cyclamen purpurascens but the packaging didn&amp;rsquo;t specify the variety) and Tulips.</description></item></channel></rss>
