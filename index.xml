new, taller stakes. They should be ready to harvest in about 10 weeks (mid October).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pilau Rice</title><link>https://foodly.site/recipes/pilau-rice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 18:31:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://foodly.site/recipes/pilau-rice/</guid><description>Ingredients 225g basmati white rice 1 tbsp olive oil or butter 1/2 medium onion, diced 1/2 tsp salt 420ml chicken or vegetable stock, water, or a mix of water and stock Method Rinse the rice in a sieve under water until the water is barley cloudy then set aside.
