I thought the pots they were in were a little small, so I&amp;rsquo;ve repotted them. Hopefully they will survive over winter.
I brought home some ceramic pots from Mam&amp;rsquo;s the other day and today I got around to cleaning (most of) them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve planted two pots of flowers for over winter. They are Cyclamen (I think they are Cyclamen purpurascens but the packaging didn&amp;rsquo;t specify the variety) and Tulips.</description></item><item><title>10 August 2020</title><link>https://foodly.site/garden-diary/2020/08/10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 20:50:57 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://foodly.site/garden-diary/2020/08/10/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve repotted some of the (surviving) Marigolds which I should have done weeks ago. A couple of them look like they might grow.
I&amp;rsquo;ve put the compost on the cauliflowers and composted the plants.</description></item><item><title>9 August 2020</title><link>https://foodly.site/garden-diary/2020/08/09/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 19:32:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foodly.site/garden-diary/2020/08/09/</guid><description>&lt;p>I planted out 5 pea plants today (&lt;em>Hurst Green Shaft&lt;/em>). The two closest to the house
are bigger and have better root systems. They should grow to about 70cm, so I&amp;rsquo;ll need
new, taller stakes. They should be ready to harvest in about 10 weeks (mid October).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
