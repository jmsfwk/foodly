            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-8">Chicken Shawarma</h1>

            <p>This is based on Nadiya Hussain&#039;s Chicken Shawarma. It makes enough of the spice mix for two meals.

A good teaspoon of garlic purée is a good addition, mix it with the chicken and oil before adding the spice mix

This recipe also works really well on a barbeque. After mixing the chicken and spices mix together cook over hot coals
until the chicken is golden.
