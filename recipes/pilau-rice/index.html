Rinse the rice in a sieve under water until the water is barley
cloudy then set aside.
Melt the butter or oil in a medium saucepan and gently fry the
onion until translucent and soft.
Add the drained rice to the pan and mix to cover with the oil.
Toast for a minute until the tips of the rice turn translucent.
Add the stock or water, and salt. Turn the heat to medium-high and
bring to the boil.
As soon as it comes to the boil turn the heat to low and cover with a
well fitting lid. Cook for 15 – 18 minutes without lifting the lid.
Check that the rice has absorbed all the liquid and is cooked, if not cook
for a couple more minutes adding a couple of tablespoons of water if needed.
Remove the pan from the heat and allow to sit, covered, for 5 – 10 minutes.
Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.

Additions like mushrooms or garlic can easily be added when frying the onions
and spices like cloves or bay leaves can be added along with the water."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=fediverse:creator content><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Pilau Rice"><meta name=twitter:description content=" Ingredients Link to heading 225g basmati white rice 1 tbsp olive oil or butter 1/2 medium onion, diced 1/2 tsp salt 420ml chicken or vegetable stock, water, or a mix of water and stock Method Link to heading Rinse the rice in a sieve under water until the water is barley cloudy then set aside.
