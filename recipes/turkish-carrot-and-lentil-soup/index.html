            <p>The bulghur and lentils add some body and protein to this smokey, comforting soup. Add a cautious pinch or two of cayenne at the end; it can be potent stuff.

This recipe is from a [Riverford](https://www.riverford.co.uk/) soup bag.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="list">
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 red peppers</li>
            <li>400g carrots</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>2 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>40g red lentils</li>
            <li>20g bulghur wheat</li>
            <li>20g flaked almonds</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>fresh mint</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Method</h2>

    <ol class="list list-decimal">
            <li>Peel and slice the onion. Deseed and slice the peppers. Peel and roughly chop the carrots. Warm 2 tbsp of oil in a large saucepan and gently fry them together for 10 minutes, until starting to soften.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, peel and chop the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, bay, cumin, lentils, and bulghur to the pan and cook for a further 2 minutes before adding 800ml of water. Bring to a simmer and season with salt and pepper. Cook gently for 25 minutes, until everything is cooked and softened.</li>
            <li>While the soup cooks, lightly toast the almonds in a dry frying pan over a medium heat, until golden.</li>
            <li>When ready, remove the bay leaf and blend until completely smooth. Thin with a little more water if it seems thick. Taste and tweak the seasoning with salt, pepper, a squeeze or two of lemon, and a cautious pinch of cayenne, to your liking.</li>
            <li>Serve and garnish with the toasted almonds and some freshly chopped mint leaves.</li>
        </ol>
