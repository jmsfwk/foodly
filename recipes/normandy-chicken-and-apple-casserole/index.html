    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Method</h2>

    <ol class="list list-decimal">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas 7  <br />
Boil half a kettle  <br />
Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat<br />
</li>
            <li>Chop the **apple** into wedges and remove the core<br />
Peel and chop the **brown onion** into wedges<br />
</li>
            <li>Add the **diced chicken thigh** to the dish with **1 tsp** flour and cook for 30 secs  <br />
Crush the **garlic cloves** open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins<br />
</li>
            <li>Add the **chopped apple** and **onion wedges** with the **crushed garlic** and give everything a good stir  <br />
Add the **chicken stock mix** and 200ml **boiled water**<br />
</li>
            <li>Add the **Chinese rice wine** and stir through with the **wholegrain mustard** and **soft cheese**  <br />
Bring to the boil over a high heat, then put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 30-35 min or until the chicken is cooked through – this is your **Normandy chicken &amp; apple casserole**<br />
</li>
            <li>Once the casserole is almost done, trim the **green beans** and add to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of **olive oil** and a pinch of **salt** (use tin foil to avoid mess!)  <br />
Add the **ciabattas** to the other side of the tray<br />
Put the tray in the oven for 7-9 min or until the green beans are tender but retaining a bite and the ciabattas are warm and crusty<br />
To serve, chop the **chives** and sprinkle them all over the **Normandy chicken &amp; apple casserole** then season with **pepper**<br />
Serve the **green beans** and **crusty ciabattas** to the side<br />
</li>
        </ol>
