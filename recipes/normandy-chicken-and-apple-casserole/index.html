Preheat the oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas 7
Boil half a kettle
Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat
Chop the apple into wedges and remove the core
Peel and chop the brown onion into wedges
Add the diced chicken thigh to the dish with 1 tsp flour and cook for 30 secs
Crush the garlic cloves open by squashing them with the side of a knife and remove the skins
Add the chopped apple and onion wedges with the crushed garlic and give everything a good stir
Add the chicken stock mix and 200ml boiled water
Add the Chinese rice wine and stir through with the wholegrain mustard and soft cheese
Bring to the boil over a high heat, then put the dish in the oven, uncovered, for 30-35 min or until the chicken is cooked through – this is your Normandy chicken & apple casserole
Once the casserole is almost done, trim the green beans and add to one side of a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt (use tin foil to avoid mess!)
Add the ciabattas to the other side of the tray
Put the tray in the oven for 7-9 min or until the green beans are tender but retaining a bite and the ciabattas are warm and crusty
To serve, chop the chives and sprinkle them all over the Normandy chicken & apple casserole then season with pepper
Serve the green beans and crusty ciabattas to the side
